#summary The Google URL Parsing and Canonicalization Library

This library is designed for client and server programs that require URL parsing, canonicalization, and relative URL resolving.

= Features =

 * Fast: hundreds of thousands of typical URLs can be parsed and
     canonicalized per second on a modern CPU. It is much faster than, for
     example, calling WinInet's corresponding functions.

   * Compatible: When possible, this library has strived for IE7 compatability.
     It supports Unix-style file URLs, as well as the more complex rules for
     Window file URLs. Note that total compatability is not possible (for
     example, IE6 and IE7 disagree about how to parse certain IP addresses),
     and that this is more strict about certain illegal, rarely used, and
     potentially dangerous constructs such as escaped control characters in
     host names that IE will allow.

   * Complete: This library is more complete than most other applications such
     as IE7, Firefox, and Safari. For example, this library is the only one out
     of those that will canonicalize IP addresses, or that can handle escaped
     UTF-8 in the host name that has been intermixed with non-escpaed UTF-16.

   * Easily embededable: Unlike most implementations of URL parsing and
     canonicalization, this library is designed to be embedded into another
     application. There is no dependency on STL (with the exception of the
     example URL object), and the only external dependencies are on character
     set conversion and IDN for which a convenient porting layer is provided.
