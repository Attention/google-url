#summary The Google URL Parsing and Canonicalization Library

This library is designed for client and server programs that require URL parsing, canonicalization, or resolving.

= Features =

 * Fast: hundreds of thousands of typical URLs can be parsed and canonicalized per second on a modern CPU. It is much faster than, for example, calling WinInet's corresponding functions.

   * Compatible: When possible, this library has strived for IE7 compatability. It supports Unix-style file URLs, as well as the more complex rules for Window file URLS.

   * Complete: This library is more complete than most other applications such as IE7, Firefox, and Safari.

   * Easily embededable: Unlike most implementations of URL parsing and canonicalization, this library is designed to be embedded into another application. There is no dependency on STL (with the exception of the example URL object), and the only external dependencies are on character set conversion and IDN for which a convenient porting layer is provided.
