#summary The Google URL Parsing and Canonicalization Library

This C++ library is designed for Unix and Windows client and server programs that require URL parsing, canonicalization, or resolving.

= Features =

 * Fast: hundreds of thousands of typical URLs can be parsed and canonicalized per second on a modern CPU.

   * Compatible: When possible, this library has strived for IE7 compatability. It supports Unix-style file URLs, as well as the more complex rules for Window file URLs.

   * Complete: This library is among the most complete implementations available.

   * Easily embededable: Unlike most implementations of URL parsing and canonicalization, this library is designed to be embedded into another application.

Please see the README.txt file in the root directory of the source distribution for more.

= Other ports =

I can't vouch for these, but you may want to give them a look if you need that functionality.
