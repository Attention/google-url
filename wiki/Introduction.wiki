#summary The Google URL Parsing and Canonicalization Library

This library is designed for Unix and Windows client and server programs that require URL parsing, canonicalization, or resolving.

= Features =

 * Fast: hundreds of thousands of typical URLs can be parsed and canonicalized per second on a modern CPU.

   * Compatible: When possible, this library has strived for IE7 compatability. It supports Unix-style file URLs, as well as the more complex rules for Window file URLs.

   * Complete: This library is among the most complete implementations available.

   * Easily embededable: Unlike most implementations of URL parsing and canonicalization, this library is designed to be embedded into another application.
